# NumPy

**NumPy** stands for Numerical Python and it's a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. NumPy provides Python with an extensive math library capable of performing numerical computations effectively and efficiently.

### Why Use NumPy

NumPy has a number of key features that give it great advantages over Python lists.
- **Speed** : When performing operations on large arrays NumPy can often perform several orders of magnitude faster than Python lists. This speed comes from the nature of NumPy arrays being memory-efficient and from optimized algorithms used by NumPy for doing arithmetic, statistical, and linear algebra operations.

- **Multidimensional array data structures** to represent vectors and matrices and optimized for matrix operations and it allows us to do Linear Algebra operations effectively and efficiently, making it very suitable for solving machine learning problems. Machine Learning algorithms rely on matrix operations.

- **Built-in Mathematical functions** NumPy has a large number of optimized built-in mathematical functions. These functions allow you to do a variety of complex mathematical computations very fast and with very little code and making programs more readable and easier to understand.
