# Pandas

**Pandas** is a package for data manipulation and analysis in Python. The name Pandas is derived from the econometrics term Panel Data. 

Pandas incorporates two additional data structures into Python
- Pandas Series 
- Pandas DataFrame. 

These data structures allow us to work with labeled and relational data in an easy and intuitive manner.

### Why Use Pandas ?

We have to train machine learning algorithms on huge amounts of data. However, when it comes to data, quantity is not the only thing that matters, the quality of your data is just as important. More often large datasets don’t come ready to be fed into your learning algorithms and have missing values, outliers, incorrect values, etc… Having data with a lot of missing or bad values, your machine learning algorithms will not perform well. 

Therefore, one very important step in machine learning is to look at your data first and make sure it is well suited for your training algorithm by doing some basic data analysis. This is where Pandas come in. Pandas Series and DataFrames are designed for fast data analysis and manipulation, as well as being flexible and easy to use.
